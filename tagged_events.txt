Title:  Electromagnetic Wave Scattering of Periodic Structures and Random Media with Applications in Engineered Electromagnetic Materials and Environmental Remote Sensing
Type:  Lecture
Sponsor:  ECE ILLINOIS
Location:  1311 Newmark
Date and Time:  5/10/2018
 12 p.m.
Details:  Abstract: Electromagnetic wave scattering of periodic structures and random media are fascinating fields with wide applications. Electromagnetic wave scattering of periodic structures is fundamental for analysis and design of engineered electromagnetic materials such as photonic crystals, metamaterials and metasurfaces, while electromagnetic wave scattering of random media constitutes the physical basis for environmental and geophysical remote sensing. In both cases, Maxwells equations are the theoretical foundations for electromagnetic wave scattering problems. In this seminar, I will present a novel and effective broadband Greens function approach that we recently developed to deal with wave interactions with periodic structures. The approach is especially suitable for field analysis around interfaces of periodic structures in engineered electromagnetic materials design. I will then present three unique yet inherently unified methods for solving Maxwells equations on dense volumetric random media: a dense media radiative transfer approach, a full wave simulation approach, and a Feynman diagram approach. Implications and impacts of these theories on various engineering problems and scientific questions will also be discussed.

Title:  Daniel Sanchez, "Making Parallelism Pervasive with the Swarm Architecture"
Type:  Lecture
Sponsor:  The Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois
Location:  2405 Siebel Center
Date and Time:  May 14, 2018 4:00 pm
Details:  Abstract:  With Moore's Law coming to an end, architects must find ways to sustain performance growth without technology scaling. The most promising path is to build highly parallel systems that harness thousands of simple and efficient cores. But this approach will require new techniques to make massive parallelism practical, as current multicores fall short of this goal: they squander most of the parallelism available in applications and are too hard to program. 
 I will present Swarm, a new architecture that successfully parallelizes algorithms that are often considered sequential and is much easier to program than conventional multicores. Swarm programs consist of tiny tasks, as small as tens of instructions each. Parallelism is implicit: all tasks follow a programmer-specified total or partial order, eliminating the correctness pitfalls of explicit synchronization (e.g., deadlock, data races, etc.). To scale, Swarm executes tasks speculatively and out of order, and efficiently speculates thousands of tasks ahead of the earliest active task to uncover enough parallelism. 
 Swarm builds on decades of work on speculative architectures and contributes new techniques to scale to large core counts, including a new execution model, speculation-aware hardware task management, selective aborts, and scalable ordered task commits. Swarm also incorporates new techniques to exploit locality and to harness nested parallelism, making parallel algorithms easy to compose and uncovering abundant parallelism in large applications. 
 Swarm accelerates challenging irregular applications from a broad set of domains, including graph analytics, machine learning, simulation, and databases. At 256 cores, Swarm is 53-561x faster than a single-core system, and outperforms state-of-the-art software-only parallel algorithms by one to two orders of magnitude. Besides achieving near-linear scalability, the resulting Swarm programs are almost as simple as their sequential counterparts, as they do not use explicit synchronization.
