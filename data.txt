        "Description": "2017 American Music Month Exhibit\nDuring the late 1960s many university campuses across America experienced significant political and social turmoil.\u00a0 For the University of Illinois the spring of 1970 was a time of tremendous political unrest among students and faculty regarding America\u2019s involvement in the Vietnam war, the US Department of Defense\u2019s construction of the Illiac IV supercomputer on campus, the Champaign-Urbana police force\u2019s killing of an unarmed African American student on the Illinois campus, and the Ohio National Guard\u2019s shooting of four students on the campus of Kent State University. \u00a0\u00a0While Illinois\u2019 students and many of its faculty frequently came together at this time to protest the Federal government\u2019s growing political oppression and imperialism, the campus\u2019 activists and protestors used many different music genres to convey their messages across the Urbana-Champaign campus.\u00a0 Music groups like the Campus Folksong Club, the Walden String Quartet, Medicare 7, 8, or 9, and REO Speedwagon as well as many faculty members from the University\u2019s School of Music frequently lent their musical talents to support these political and social protests. \u00a0This exhibit of photographs, news clippings, advertisements, protest broadsides, concert programs, graphic illustrations, and audio recordings highlight the diverse intersections of music, art, and protest on the Illinois campus during the 1970 school year.\nFor more information, please visit\u00a0https://archives.library.illinois.edu/sousa/american-music-month/.\u00a0",

        "Description": "Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme make collaborative work informed by the artists\u2019 research with historical archives, literature, underground music, and film. And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L. Powell, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\nKrannert Art Museum exhibitions are made possible in part by a generous grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L. Powell, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\nKrannert Art Museum exhibitions are made possible in part by a generous grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

        "Originating Calendar": "Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme make collaborative work informed by the artists\u2019 research with historical archives, literature, underground music, and film. And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L. Powell, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\nKrannert Art Museum exhibitions are made possible in part by a generous grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future.

Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination.

In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials.

In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L. Powell, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\nKrannert Art Museum exhibitions are made possible in part by a generous grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. And yet my mask is powerful is presented in collaboration with Asian American Studies and the Center for South Asian & Middle Eastern Studies.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours. Visit the Museum\u2019s website to learn more http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/events/#ui150.\nKnowledge at Work runs September 12, 2017\u2013December 21, 2018 and was developed in partnership with the University of Illinois Archives.",

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

By learning about the ancestral and current views and practices of the Andean people, educators will be able to see how cultural diversity is the result of careful balance between community needs and careful use of natural and cultural resources.\nThis workshop will cover these basic topics:(i) The linguistic diversity of the Andean region (including its interaction with Spanish);(ii) the syncretism its culture offers between modern and Pre(Pre---Columbian beliefs;(iii) the social organization of indigenous people and the notions of solidarity and extended family as community;(iv) the solutions that Andean people offer to problems like climate change and the risks of uncontrolled economic growth.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours. Visit the Museum\u2019s website to learn more http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/events/#ui150.\nKnowledge at Work runs September 12, 2017\u2013December 21, 2018 and was developed in partnership with the University of Illinois Archives.",

By learning about the ancestral and current views and practices of the Andean people, educators will be able to see how cultural diversity is the result of careful balance between community needs and careful use of natural and cultural resources.\nThis workshop will cover these basic topics:(i) The linguistic diversity of the Andean region (including its interaction with Spanish);(ii) the syncretism its culture offers between modern and Pre(Pre---Columbian beliefs;(iii) the social organization of indigenous people and the notions of solidarity and extended family as community;(iv) the solutions that Andean people offer to problems like climate change and the risks of uncontrolled economic growth.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials.

Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L. Powell, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\nKrannert Art Museum exhibitions are made possible in part by a generous grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. And yet my mask is powerful is presented in collaboration with Asian American Studies and the Center for South Asian & Middle Eastern Studies. Paid in part by the Student Cultural Programming Fee.\nAll exhibitions are free and open to the public, open during normal museum hours.

And yet my mask is powerful stages encounters with materials from Palestine through installation, sound, cinema, and an artists\u2019 book.\nThe exhibition has two parts. Part 1 is a video and sound installation. The camera follows a group of young people on a springtime walk through the ruins of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. We see them uncover masks, try them on, and descend into a cave. Staging new rituals of recuperation and discovery, their movements are framed by text the artists edited from Adrienne Rich\u2019s award-winning poem Diving into the Wreck (1972). Transposed in English and Arabic, the text forgoes metaphors\u2014seeking not the story of the wreck, but the wreck itself\u2014and searches for what can possibly be retrieved from such a disastrous site. Rich\u2019s feminist screed describes a solitary figure who draws on existing structures yet embarks alone toward a society without domination. Abbas and Abou-Rahme repurpose her words to question colonial legacies and occupation.\nPart II resembles a scholarly study or museum storage encompassing both prehistoric time and the digital future. Neolithic limestone masks excavated near the Dead Sea and in the West Bank in the 1980s are \u201chacked\u201d and reproduced using 3D technology. Printed images overlap with one another against deep blue walls while masks are unpacked, notations taken, plant specimens collected. The installation appears like a brain, inviting visitors to draw connections and peer into the artists\u2019 multi-layered research process.\nAbbas and Abou-Rahme are insurgent samplers of culture, digital bandits. And yet my mask is powerful opens possibilities for reimagining fraught histories through narratives other than endless crisis.\nBasel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme\u2019s work has been featured in exhibitions at the Palestinian Museum, the ICA Philadelphia, Portikus, Kunsthalle Wien, the Warsaw Museum of Modern Art, the ICA London, and the Sharjah, S\u00e3o Paulo, Istanbul, Gwangju, and Liverpool biennials. They were awarded the Abraaj Group Art Prize in 2016 and the Sharjah Biennial Prize in 2015. This exhibition is the United States premiere of And yet my mask is powerful.\nCurated by Amy L. Powell, curator of Modern and Contemporary Art.\nKrannert Art Museum exhibitions are made possible in part by a generous grant from The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts. And yet my mask is powerful is presented in collaboration with Asian American Studies and the Center for South Asian & Middle Eastern Studies.

Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours.

        "Title": "2017 American Music Month Exhibit\nThe Russian imperial capital of St. Petersburg was a major stop during John Philip Sousa\u2019s 1903 tour of Europe.\u00a0 Sousa planned his St. Petersburg performances to coincide with the tsar\u2019s birthday and the bicentennial of the city\u2019s founding, and anticipated large audiences for these concerts because the band had never before played in Russia.\u00a0 What resulted, however, was a misadventure.\u00a0 The concerts occurred at the beginning of Russia\u2019s annual summer vacation when most theaters and concerts halls were closed.\u00a0 In addition Russian music critics\u2019 responses to his music was tepid.\u00a0 Sousa was intimidated by the extensive advertising throughout the city for what he initially believed to be his music rival \u0421\u0443\u0437\u0430, but eventually discovered that this was the Russian spelling of his own name. \u00a0\u00a0While the St. Petersburg performances were not well attended, the concerts did spark deep patriotism among the American diplomats who were able to attend and the Russian aristocracy and military enthusiastically received the Sousa Band\u2019s renditions of the Imperial Russian and American national anthems.\u00a0 This exhibit of photographs, music, newspaper reviews, and political cartoons document Russian perceptions of America and Sousa\u2019s music at the beginning of the twentieth century.\nFor more information, please visit\u00a0https://archives.library.illinois.edu/sousa/american-music-month/.\u00a0",

        "Event Type": "The exhibit Knowledge at Work: The University of Illinois at 150 traces the connections between the University of Illinois and people, places, and ideas near and far. Explore this community of educators, researchers, and students over decades of learning, research, and public service. Learn about contributions of a wide variety of people and groups to campus history and ways the University has changed how it relates to the people it serves.\n\u00a0\nFrom its founding as a Land Grant institution in 1867 focused on agriculture and engineering, through expansions into arts, graduate studies, and national and international collaborations, the University has maintained a mission to deliver education and research in service to society. In Knowledge at Work, we look at the role of the University of Illinois as a nexus for bringing together people with diverse backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in a common pursuit. The background and needs of students and faculty have changed over time, inspiring new facilities, curricula, and services.\nOn display are artifacts, documents, and photographs from throughout the University\u2019s history: books from the first library collection, a course schedule from 1877, panels from early ILLIAC computers, and Olympian Jean Driscoll\u2019s racing chair.\nThe exhibit is accompanied by a series of events for all ages: talks, exhibit tours with the curator, family hands-on activities, and historic campus walking tours. Visit the Museum\u2019s website to learn more http://www.spurlock.illinois.edu/events/#ui150.\nKnowledge at Work runs September 12, 2017\u2013December 21, 2018 and was developed in partnership with the University of Illinois Archives.",

        "Description": "2017 American Music Month Exhibit\nThe University of Illinois Russian Folk Orchestra was founded in 1974 by John Garvey, who had joined the University\u2019s Walden String Quartet in 1948 as its violist and in 1959 established the university\u2019s jazz band program.\u00a0 In 1969, the jazz band toured the Soviet Union as part of the State Department\u2019s cultural exchange program, and Garvey developed a keen interest in Russian folk music.\u00a0 He later returned to the USSR to study Russian folk music traditions and purchased additional folk instruments that he used to establish the Illinois Russian Folk Orchestra.\u00a0 The Illinois ensemble eventually served as a model for other American universities\u2019 Russian folk orchestras by providing open depoliticized educational spaces for students to pursue their interest in Russian folk music traditions.\u00a0 This exhibit of folk instruments, photographs, and music provides visitors with a general introduction to Russian folk music traditions and culture that were promoted by the Soviet Union after the Russian Revolution and the folk musicians who immigrated to the United States after WWII.\u00a0 It also acknowledges many of the talented musicians who performed with the University of Illinois\u2019 Russian Folk Orchestra under Garvey\u2019s direction between 1974 and 1989 and reveals a forgotten part of the University of Illinois\u2019 musical past.\nFor more information, please visit\u00a0https://archives.library.illinois.edu/sousa/american-music-month/.\u00a0",
