Workshop participants will work closely with one another and, as a result, have the opportunity to network and establish relationships with people who are engaging in similar activities. There is no cost to participate in the Bootcamp. Breakfast, lunch, and some dinners will be provided. Attendees will need to pay for travel, hotel, and remaining dinners.\nParticipants will learn:\n\nCore business strategy skills as they apply to leading an online digital presence, such as understanding stakeholder and user needs; business, operations, finance, and resource planning; and project management;\nTechnology best practices, including the principles of cybersecurity; software architecture, development practices, and tools that ensure implementation of strong software engineering methods; usability do\u2019s and don\u2019ts; and\nLong-term sustainability strategies, such as alternative funding models; case studies of successful gateway efforts; licensing choices and their impact on sustainability; planning for and measuring your impact.\n\nBy the end of the workshop, participants will have developed a \"pitch deck\" of their sustainability strategy and identified the key action steps to get there. Participants will also build relationships with other participants engaged in creating gateways and learn about the in-depth consultations they might seek from the SGCI.",

It is imperative that the importance and benefits of a field with such far reaching impact embrace the diverse demographic of the future workforce for whom data visualization skills will be needed if not required. In order to meet the growing demand for persons with capacity to utilize data visualization to solve complex problems in research and in the workforce exposure to data visualization at all levels is essential. This workshop aims to be a catalyst for broadening participation of women, members of underrepresented groups and underrepresented disciplines in visualization, fostering a community of current and future scholars with interests in visualization through mentoring and encouraging participants to consider visualization as a career path. The workshop is designed to inform, inspire and encourage participants, specifically participants historically underrepresented at the conference, to engage in the multidisciplinary dynamics of visualization.",
